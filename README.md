# SocialMe
An app to easily and effortlessly manage all social network accounts, saving space and data usage via one Feed
Two mayor problems and a wonderful opportunity. 1. In order to manage all our social media we need an app for every site and we need to check one by one to respond publish or make changes that takes a lot of time uses a lot of our data and wastes time.
With a centralized application that will have tabs for every social network account, email, and website we could receive a simple notification when an update is made, we could also publish to different or all of our accounts all in once.
The most useful thing, connected to OUR other proyect, GlobalMind Currency (Crypto) we could earn commisions for every aspect that we contribute to the benefit of all or our specific "Niche".
